## What I learned
2017/01/03

1. Complete "Dot Install" android tutorial.
 - Create button and textarea.
 - Add code to change the text using the button.
 - Note:
    - autocrlf setting makes line end character LF when you push to github.
    - Local changes dialog shows some files have different line end.
    - You can resolve the problem to pull files from github.

2. Next tutorial is on Github [mixi-inc](https://github.com/mixi-inc/AndroidTraining).
 - I notice that I have been developed android apps before, but I don't even know basic knowledge about android. I need to learn systematically about it.
 - Now, studying about sdk at practice of section 1-4.

2017/01/02

1. Push to Github with Android Studio.
 - Sign up for Github.
 - Repository is [here](https://github.com/mike-r155/edu-1).
 - Note:
    - Do **NOT** create repository before you push from "VCS > Import into Version Control > Share project on GitHub"
    - If you have already done it, use "VCS > Git... > Push Commits > origin : master"
